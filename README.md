Provides basic functions to work with variables for type `iterable` (added in PHP 7.1).
Primarily to transform variables of type `iteratble`  into more specific types such as `array`.

If you have an iterable somewhere and you need to pass it to a function that only takes an `array`
or an `Iterator`, you have a problem. You will need to add conditional logic to find out the type
of the value and transform it if needed, which gets quite involved in the case of needing an `Iterator`.

This problem is quite common, as PHP's standard library, as of version 7.1, tends to either require
arrays, iterators or traversables.

Example:

```php
function doStuff(iterable $iterable) {
    $iterableMinusFooBar = array_diff( $iterable, [ 'foo', 'bar' ] );
}
// Output: array_diff(): Argument #1 is not an array
```

## Installation

To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a
dependency on `wmde/iterable-functions` to your project's `composer.json` file.
Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on
Iterable Functions 1.x:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "wmde/iterable-functions": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

## Usage

**When you need an array**

```php
use function WMDE\IterableFunctions\iterable_to_array as iterable_to_array;

function doStuff(iterable $iterable) {
    $iterableMinusFooBar = array_diff( iterable_to_array( $iterable ), [ 'foo', 'bar' ] );
}
```

**When you need an Iterator**

```php
use function WMDE\IterableFunctions\iterable_to_iterator as iterable_to_iterator;

function doStuff(iterable $iterable) {
    $firstFewThings = new LimitIterator( iterable_to_iterator( $iterable ), 42 );
}
```

**When you want to merge several iterators**

```php
use function WMDE\IterableFunctions\iterable_merge as iterable_merge

function doStuff(iterable $iterable1, iterable $iterator2) {
    foreach(iterable_to_merge( $iterable1, $iterable2 ) as $item) {
       // ...
    }
}
```
